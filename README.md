# Splay Tree Implementation with Visualization

This project provides a Python implementation of a **Splay Tree** along with a console-based visualization to help you see how the tree changes with each operation.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Insert, lookup, delete, and split.
- **Visualization**: After each operation, the tree structure is printed to the console, so you can follow along.

## Splay Tree

A splay tree is a type of binary search tree that self-adjusts to keep recently accessed elements near the top. This makes future operations on those elements faster.


## Example Output

Here's how the tree might look after some insertions:

```
└── 5
    ┌── 8
    │   ┌── 9
    │   └── 7
    └── 3
        ┌── 4
        └── 2
            └── 1
```


Hope you enjoy exploring splay trees!
